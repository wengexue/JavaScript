To represent a character in JavaScript use a string with a single 
character in it: 'a', 'b', 'c'. There are also [escape sequences][escs]:

## Overview 

The goal of this assignment is to get all the tests to pass and to be
sure jshint returns zero errors. You must:

- Use **String.split** in each method for **Splits.js**
- Use **String.slice** in each method for **Slices.js**

As a general rule the answers in the body of a solution are a single line 
of code. You will also include **use strict**, so that is two lines. A
few questions do require additional lines of code, but in general, the
solutions are short.

## Run the tests

To get started:

	npm install
	./RunMocha
	
You can also start the tests this way:

	npm test
	
## Turn it in

Copy your version of the solution to your repository and place it in
the root of a folder called Week02-SplitSlice. Check it in. When you 
submit the assignment be sure include the URL of your repository. It
should look something like this:

	git@bitbucket.com:lastname/lastname.git
