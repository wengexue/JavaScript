        | Note that in our tests we never click (trigger) the <strong>Get Scientists</strong> button
        | because we have not provided a way to know when it returns with our JSON. We can however,
        | call the public method of <strong>Control.js</strong> called <strong>getScientists</strong>.
        | That method can be usefully called by our tests because we can know when it returns.
        | In particular, we pass it a callback which is called when it retrieves the JSON we requested.
