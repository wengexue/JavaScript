<h2>JSON Area</h2>
<p>
    Note that in our tests we never click (trigger) the <strong>Get Scientists</strong> button
    because we have not provided a way to know when it returns with our JSON. We can however,
    call the public method of <strong>Control.js</strong> called <strong>getScientists</strong>.
    That method can be usefully called by our tests because we can know when it returns.
    In particular, we pass it a callback which is called when it retrieves the JSON we requested.
